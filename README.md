# Just Another Text Editor
Alright, alright, alright! This right here is a full-stack application, my friends. It's a text editor that showcases some real fine code-writing capabilities, right in your browser. You can take it offline, install it, and rest easy knowing that it'll keep your precious code safe and sound, whether you're online or not.

## About
Now, let me tell you a little somethin'. This bad boy right here is powered by the mighty idb package. It harnesses the raw power of IndexedDB to let you get and store your data even when this editor ain't in focus. That's some real handy functionality, wouldn't you say? And not to forget, it's got those registered service workers, courtesy of workbox. These workers make sure all your static assets are pre-cached, ready to roll as soon as you load up this editor.

## Where to use it
If you're lookin' to dive into the code and see what makes this editor tick, head on over to [GitHub](https://github.com/ashtreid/TextSmith). You'll find all the goods there, ripe for exploration. And if you're ready to take this editor for a spin, give it a go on [Heroku](). It's just a click away.

There you have it, my friend. Enjoy using this text editor and may your code flow like the mighty river.
